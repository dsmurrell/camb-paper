Are QSAM and proteochemometrics subsets of chemogenomics?? (can't list them together if they are, multiple places).

I've reordered the occurrence of things pertaining to property prediction to come first, since people that might want to do PCM stuff need those anyway and people who only want to do QSPR only need the stuff mentioned first.
